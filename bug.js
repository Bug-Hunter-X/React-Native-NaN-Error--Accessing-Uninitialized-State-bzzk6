This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens in functional components before the first render. Consider this example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count + 1}</Text> {/* Error prone line */} 
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this case, during the initial render, `count` is `undefined`. Adding 1 to `undefined` results in `NaN`, causing the error.
